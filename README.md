**Shelf Shuffler** is a premium board game catalog generator. It transforms your BoardGameGeek collection into a tactile, high-art "Catalog Deck"—perfect for shelf organization, game selection, or creating a physical record of your hobby.

---

## 💎 The "Catalog Deck" Aesthetic
Shelf Shuffler utilizes a specialized **Full-Art TCG design** optimized for both digital viewing and physical printing:
- **Sectioned Title Header**: Dedicated title bars prevent obstruction of game logos on box art.
- **Glassmorphism Overlays**: Vibe stats (players, time, weight) and summaries float on blurred, high-contrast panels.
- **Micro-Information Footer**: Compact, icon-driven credits for designers (`User`) and artists (`SwatchBook`).
- **Tactile Print Finish**: Subtle physical linen canvas overlays added to every card for a premium "poker card" feel.
- **Print-Ready Perfection**: Automated 3x3 grids for A4/Letter with safety borders and cut guides.

## 🚀 Features
- **Instant BGG Sync**: Connect your collection simply by entering your BGG username.
- **Performant Caching**: Intelligent client-side caching ensures near-instant repeat lookups and reduced API load.
- **Dynamic Customization**: Live-toggle card components (Title, Designer, Artist, Weight, Description).
- **Batch Processing**: Rapidly build print queues with optimized, batched API requests.
- **Global Character Support**: Robust HTML entity decoding for flawless international titles and accents.
